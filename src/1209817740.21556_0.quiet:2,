I don't understand this completely, but it's very interesting.  There's a
relationship between communication complexity (information theory) and the
difference between P and NP.  At the same time (not covered here, but I
guess I've mentioned it elsewhere), information theory is somehow
connected with quantum mechanics.  It seems that there's something "deep"
about information and how our world works.
